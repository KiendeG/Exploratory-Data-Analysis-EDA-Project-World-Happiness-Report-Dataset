**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project: World Happiness Report Dataset**

**Objective:**
Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the World Happiness Report dataset to uncover 
insights and patterns related to global happiness. 

**Dataset:**
Download from World Happiness Report on Kaggle. 


**Instructions:** 
**1. Introduction:** 
Download and load the dataset into pandas; 
Display the first few rows.

**2. Data Understanding:** 
Show data types and summary statistics.

**3. Data Cleaning:** 
Handle missing values (impute/drop); 
Remove duplicates; 
Standardize categorical data and ensure correct data types.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
Univariate: Histograms of happiness scores and features; 
Bivariate: Correlation matrix and scatter plots; 
Multivariate: Pair plots and facet grids; 
Time Series (if applicable): Line plots for trends.

**5. Data Visualization:** 
Create a choropleth map of happiness scores; 
Visualize distributions by region or income group;  
Use bar or box plots for factor impacts.

**6. Additional Notes:** 
Feel free to explore other analyses and visualizations that you think are relevant 
and interesting; 
Work in pairs and share your final work on GitHub.

**7. Conclusion:** 
Summarize findings and insights; 
Discuss implications for global happiness.

**Tools/Libraries:**
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook 

**Deliverables:** 
A Jupyter Notebook or report documenting the entire EDA process. 
Include code, visualizations, and written observations. 
Clearly convey insights about global happiness and factors influencing it.
